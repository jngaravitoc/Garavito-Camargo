title: Outreach & Diversity

I am interested in the social side of Astronomy. I strongly believe that everyone
should have access to Astronomy and everyone should feel respected and safe inside the
Astronomy community. Below you can find outreach and diversity projects 
in which I have been involved in the past years. 

## Diversity Journal Club at Steward Observatory:

Along with [Samantha Scibelli](https://samscibelli.github.io/), Erin Maier, and
[Carlos Vargas](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/postdoctoral/carlos-j-vargas) we organize
the [diversity Journal Club](https://www.as.arizona.edu/diversity_coffee)
at the Astronomy department in the Steward Observatory. This is a space created
to engage with the community at all levels on topics of equity, inclusion, and
diversity. 

## Astrocharlas

[Astrocharlas](https://astrocharlas.github.io/schedule.html) Are Spanish lecture series for
the Tucson community that take place at the Steward Observatory once a semester. 
I co-organize this talks along with [Raphael Hviding](https://www.as.arizona.edu/~rehviding/), and 
[Professor Gurtina Besla](https://lavinia.as.arizona.edu/~gbesla/Welcome.html).

## Astrobitos

I've been an writer for Astrobitos since 2017. 
Astrobitos, is the spanish version of astrobites. We write summaries of
astronomy papers three times per week. Astrobitos's members are all
astronomy graduate students and postdocs. 

## Astronomia periferica

Astronomia periferica was a program funded by the IAU [office for
development](http://www.astro4dev.org/)
that took place in Bogota, Colombia. Astronomia periferica was targeted to 
kids of poor neighbors of Bogota. We did several hand on activities that
involved science and arts motivated by physical concepts, such as light, 
dimensions and space. Our final project, involved building two exoplanets 
with different "atmospheres", this project was presented by the kids and became
a one month exhibition in the Planetarium of Bogota.
