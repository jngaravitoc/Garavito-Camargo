## [Hunting for the Dark Matter Wake induced by the Large Magellanic Cloud]("https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190205089G/abstract")

Here, you can find visuals that complement our paper <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05089">Hunting for the Dark Matter  Wake Induced by the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)</a>. The figures
below show the perturbations caused by the LMC in <a href="#headline1">densities</a> and kinematics of
the Stellar Halo of the Milky Way. For the kinematics, we measure the velocity
 dispersion and mean velocities in the <a href="#headline2">radial</a>,
<a href="#headline3">longitudinal</a>, and
  <a href="#headline4">latitudinal</a> components.
      The figures show spherical projections in Mollweide coordinates at
different Galactocentric radii. If you find
            these plots useful and you happen to need the data, please don't
