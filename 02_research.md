I am mainly interested in learning about the nature of Dark Matter
from a galactic dynamics perspective. In particular, satellite-host
interactions such as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Milky Way.  
I've run numerical simulations and build MW's DM halo potentials using Basis
Field Expansions (BFE) to accurately capture its time evolution in the last
2 Gyrs.

### [Hunting for the Dark Matter Wake induced by the Large Magellanic Cloud](./lmc) 
### [(Paper link)]("https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190205089G/abstract")

| <img align="middle" src="./images/wake_2d.png" width="1600"/> | The LMC is the most massive satellite of the Milky Way (MW), roughly a tenth of its mass, and in its currently on it first passage around the MW. Such a massive satellite generate the strongest Dark Matter Wake in the Milky Way. In this paper, present a suite of eight high-resolution (mp = 1.2 x 10^4 Msun) that reproduce the MW-LMC interaction since the LMC just entered the MW's DM halo ~2 Gyr ago.  We quantified the density and kinematic perturbation produced by the Dark Matter Wake. [Read more here...](./lmc) | 


### The impact of gas bulk rotation on the Lyman alpha line:  [(Paper link)]("https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...795..120G/abstract")

| <img align="middle" src="./images/lyman-alpha.png" width="1200"/>  | During my masters degree I ran radiative transfer simulations of the resonant line, Lyman alpha using [CLARA](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.415.3666F/abstract). In our paper, we showed how a rotating gasous halo around a galaxy shapes the observed morpohlogy of the Lyman$\alpha$ line. |
