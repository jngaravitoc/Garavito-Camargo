## [Hunting for the Dark Matter Wake induced by the Large Magellanic Cloud]("https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190205089G/abstract")

The LMC is the most massive satellite of the Milky Way (MW), roughly a tenth of its
mass, and in its currently on it first passage around the MW. Such a massive satellite
generate the strongest Dark Matter Wake in the Milky Way. In this paper, we quantified 
the density enhance and kinematic perturbation produced by the Dark Matter Wake.
