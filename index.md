## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="ng.jpg">


Hi! Iâ€™m a Ph.D candidate at Steward Observatory. I study the dynamics of the
Milky Way and its satellite galaxies to understand its formation history and
what can it tell us about Dark Matter. I am particularly interested in modeling
the interaction between the Milky Way and its more massive satellite, the Large
Magellanic Cloud. I use N-body simulations and numerical methods to build Milky
Way gravitational potentials. Currently, I am working with Professor Gurtina
Besla.
