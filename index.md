| <img class="profile-picture" src="./ng.jpg" width="800"> | Hi! Iâ€™m a postdoctoral fellow at the [Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/) at the Flatiron Institute. I study the dynamics of the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies to understand how dark matter is distributed about the galaxy. To do this I make idealized N-body simulations and analyze zoom-in cosmological simulations, such as FIRE or Auriga. I also use Basis Function Expansions to understand the out of equilibrium dynamical regimes of Dark Matter halos. |
